# Using nodemon
To start using nodemon, we need to change our start script from:
  "start": "node app.js",
to
  "start": "nodemon app.js",
Our script will look for a nodemon tool that we installed in our node_modules.

If we simply type 'nodemon app.js', it will not work, because the terminal will try to find a global script named nodemon. By using npm to launch it, it will look for the local packages.

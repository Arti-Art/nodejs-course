# npm install nodemon --save-dev

## nodemon
Nodemon is an npm package that allows us to reload our server whenever we change some code and save, instead of quitting the process and restarting.

## --save-dev
It will install our package as a development dependency.
We don't need nodemon when our app runs on a real server (in production) because the code will not change and we don't need to restart the server.

## --save
The --save option is no longer needed with npm because installed modules are added as a dependency by default.

## -g
This flag will install the package globally on my machine (not in my project) so that I can use it anywhere.

## the ^ character
In our package.json, the ^ character next to the dependency version means that the package will be updated to the latest version if you rerun npm install
  Ex:
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20"
  }

## npm start
You can start your main 'start' script with npm start, which is a shortcut. All other scripts need to be started with npm run scriptName.
